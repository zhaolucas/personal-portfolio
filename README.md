## Description 

The repository: 

The personal porfolio project is an endeavor focused on designing a webpage of a portfolio of work to demonstrate web development proficiency. This allows the owner to display skills visually and aesthetically to potential employers. This project entails displaying five projects that are deployed live on the web. 

The primary goal of the project is to ensure the HTML and CSS codebase is semantically correct, logically structured, and all the links open up to the individual projects. 

Key skills include using flexbox, media queries and variables. 

This project is driven by the intention to emulate the mock up page to look like it as much as possible.

## Usage 

![Alt text](<images/Screenshot 2023-11-28 at 22.17.19.png>)

The page loads three sections: 
1) about me: name, avator, description
2) work: five projects with titled images of applications; the first application is larger than the rest; when clicked on the title, the application is opened to the deployed page.
3) contact: social media, number and email
4) layout should be responsive to the size of the screens and devices.
